# ðŸ§  Threat Hunting Projects

Welcome to my **Threat Hunting Projects Repository** â€” a detailed collection of hands-on investigations, detections, and analyses focused on identifying, understanding, and mitigating malicious activity within enterprise environments.

Each project in this repository documents a specific **threat event**, complete with:
- Steps taken by the adversary or simulated "bad actor"
- Associated **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** and log artifacts
- Relevant **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)** or other telemetry tables
- **KQL queries** used for detection and correlation
- Validation details and analyst commentary

This repository serves as both a **portfolio of applied threat hunting work** and a **reference for detection engineering and incident response.**
